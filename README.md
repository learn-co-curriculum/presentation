## Objectives
1. Practice giving a technical talk
2. Be able to speak about your work

## Introduction
Developers are frequently surprised to discover that _sales_ is part of being a developer. Want to do project X? You have to _sell_ people on joining your startup. Want to become a _senior_ resource? You have to _sell_ a review team on your solutions' merits having demonstrated your readiness for the next challenge.

Ultimately, the venue in which you grow this capability is in the front of the room, showing off your product _and your code_.

## Format
You are going to give a standard 10 minute tour of your solution. Here's a suggested breakdown.

1. Demonstrate your application (3-4 minutes)
2. Show some clever or noteworthy code. _Alternatively_ show your amazing `git` hygiene. _Alternatively_ show off your amazing deployment solution. Talk about these in a way that's interesting to the audience and share with them what you learned. Example: "I thought it would be interesting to try a strict "Gitflow" `git` behavior (describe the rules, describe the outcome for you, etc.) (3-4 minutes)
3. Something that went well
4. Something that was a learning experience (maybe it didn't go so well)
5. Where will you take this if you have more time? Will you take it anywhere else?
